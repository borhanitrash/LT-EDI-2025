# Detecting Racial Hoaxes in Code-Mixed Hindi-English Social Media Data: LT-EDI@LDK 2025

## Abstract
This paper presents our system for the detection of racial hoaxes in code-mixed Hindi-English social media narratives, which is in reality a form of debunking of online disinformation claiming fake incidents against a racial group. We experiment with different modeling techniques on HoaxMixPlus dataset of 5,102 annotated YouTube comments. In our approach, we utilize traditional machine learning classifiers (SVM, LR, RF), deep learning models (CNN, CNN-LSTM, CNN-BiLSTM), and transformer-based architectures (MuRIL, XLM-RoBERTa, HingRoBERTa-mixed). Experiments show that transformer-based methods substantially outperform traditional approaches, and the HingRoBERTa-mixed model is the best one with an F1 score of 0.7505. An error analysis identifies the difficulty of recognizing implicit bias and nuanced contexts in complex hoaxes. Our team was 5th place in the challenge with an F1 score of 0.69. This work contributes to combating online misinformation in low-resource linguistic environments and highlights the effectiveness of specialized language models for code-mixed content.

# Caste and Migration Hate Speech Detection: LT-EDI@LDK 2025

## Abstract
This paper presents our system for detecting caste and migration-related hate speech in Tamil social media comments, addressing the challenges in this low-resource language setting. We experimented with multiple approaches on a dataset of 7,875 annotated comments. Our methodology encompasses traditional machine learning classifiers (SVM, Random Forest, KNN), deep learning models (CNN, CNN-BiLSTM), and transformer-based architectures (MuRIL, IndicBERT, XLM-RoBERTa). Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that transformer-based models substantially outperform traditional approaches, with MuRIL-large achieving the highest performance with a macro F1 score of 0.8092. Error analysis reveals challenges in detecting implicit and culturally-specific hate speech expressions requiring deeper socio-cultural context. Our team ranked 5th in the LT-EDI@LDK 2025 shared task with an F1 score of 0.80916. This work contributes to combating harmful online content in low-resource languages and highlights the effectiveness of large pre-trained multilingual models for nuanced text classification tasks.
